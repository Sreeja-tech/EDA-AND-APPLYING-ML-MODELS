# EDA-AND-APPLYING-ML-MODELS

This project starts with a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA), using visualization tools to understand the dataset's characteristics, such as the number of passengers per airline and average ticket prices. This phase likely involves data preprocessing, including cleaning, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables, laying a foundational understanding of the data's structure and trends.

Following the EDA, the notebook introduces six different machine learning models: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, XGBoost, AdaBoost, and Gradient Boost. Each model is applied to predict flight prices, and the notebook highlights their performance. Remarkably, all models achieve over 90% prediction accuracy, with Random Forest Regression standing out with a 96.5% accuracy rate. This high level of accuracy indicates a well-executed feature engineering and model tuning process, showcasing the effectiveness of the applied methods in the context of flight price prediction.

In summary, this notebook appears to be a comprehensive analysis combining data visualization, preprocessing, and advanced machine learning techniques. It demonstrates a methodical approach to predicting flight prices, emphasizing the practical application of various statistical and machine learning models to achieve high accuracy in predictions.
